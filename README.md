# PewBDie

A cloth simulation based on the paper [Position Based Dynamics written by Matthias MÃ¼ller et al.](http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf). It is developed in CLion and rendered in Houdini. Partio and glm are used. Stretching constraint, fixed point constraint, collision constraint and bending constraint are implemented.
